In this project I've made a refactoring of the above mentioned [Quiz-App-on-React](https://github.com/gennady-bars/Quiz-App-on-React) using Redux. 
I've made 4 reducers for 4 different Container-Components in React which used their own state: 
* QuizList 
* Authorisation 
* QuizCreation (only with admin access)
* CustomQuizCreation (only after a user signs in)

### You can create your own tests or quizes if you sign up / sing in.
#### If not - you can just pass my English tests available without registration.
